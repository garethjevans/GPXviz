module ToDo exposing (..)

--TODO: Cater for parallel and divergent segments.

--TODO: Radiused bends for horizontal turns. (May turn out as special case of previous.)

--TODO: Use elm-units and elm-geometry throughout!

--TODO: Some way to join the start and end of a loop (although MR does this). (Tim Sinclair)
-- (Thinking: bracket points near the start and end, and have special button to create midpoint.
-- Or, in 1st person mode, drop marker at/near start, move to/near end, have special Join button.
-- Then just use other tools for smoothing.

--TODO: Improve removal of zero lengths so we don't have to repeat ourselves!

--TODO: Optional gradient-coloured centre line. (1st and Plan views) (Jarie Steffenson)

--TODO: Tidy up view logic.

--TODO: Single Entity list, built for current view
